## Kyle Keane
[Dr. Kyle M. Keane](http://www.kylekeane.com/) is currently a Lecturer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. he teaches computational materials science, human-centered design, and engineering technology that helps people with disabilities. He directs an undergraduate research group called the Interactive Materials Education Laboratory (IMEL) where students use technology and computation to make science more tangible and creatively engaging.  He has also been [an R&D Fellow at Wolfram Research Inc.](https://community.wolfram.com/web/kylek)

In his career, he has worked at well-established software companies, digital publishers, early-stage machine learning startups, and world-class universities. He has served in the roles of theoretical physicist, computational materials scientist, software developer, educational evangelist, business development associate, user experience designer, instructional designer, research director, and lecturer. His passions lie at the intersections of computational science, design, engineering, education, assistive technology, and advocacy. He has technical expertise in the rapid prototyping of both software products and physical devices, facilitating learning experiences, and leading long-term collaborative group efforts. He has a long-term goal of reframing the narrative of “living with a disability or diagnosis” into a relatable perspective that drives innovation while illuminating our shared human experience. He also has a deep personal relationship with positive psychology, wellness, community building, and performance.

## The EduVis - 'Pat Roberts Accessible Calculator Benefit' Entertainment Book fundraiser

[https://www.entertainment.com.au/orderbooks/965j898](https://www.entertainment.com.au/orderbooks/965j898)

EduVis Entertainment Book Fundraising is distributed towards $500 bursaries to purchase expensive accessible calculators for Yr.10-12 Australian maths students with blindness and vision impairment.

It is anticipated that having an accessible calculator will improve student independence and improve the retention rate of students with BVI studying senior maths in secondary schools.

We are most grateful for donations to the benefit from Ronda & Barrie Moeller, Nicole Monroe & Sonja Braniff.

## Maple 2022 and Screen Reader Cheat-sheet

Maple is a CAS software calculator approved by VCAA as an alternative to hardware CAS calculators. Charlie Roberts has developed a cheat sheet with the team at Ases, one of the re-sellers for Maplesoft, the company that makes Maple. The document summarises how to use the graphical and command-line interfaces of Maple 2022 with NVDA and JAWS but mostly NVDA.

You can find out more and download it [here](/maple-2022-cheat-sheet/).

<h2>Acknowledgement of Country</h2>
<p>The Eduvis location of Melbourne rests on the lands of the <a href="https://www.wurundjeri.com.au/">Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung clans of the Kulin Nation</a>. In the spirit of reconciliation, the contributors to Eduvis acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of Country throughout Australia and their stewardship of the land, sea and community. We pay our respect to the Elders of these First Nations people past, present and emerging, extending that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples today As we continue to learn to live together on these ancestral lands.</p>
